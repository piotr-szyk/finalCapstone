## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
This project demonstrates an understanding of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and its applications.
It is divided into two sections: Task 21 and Task 22. The first section focuses on building a system that
can recommend what to watch next based on the word vector similarity of the description of the movies.
The second part is descriptive and focuses on natural language processing applications, such as text 
classification and sentiment analysis.








## Requirements for the DS (Data Science) T21 Semantic Similarity (NLP)
### Compulsory Task 1
Follow these steps:
- Create a file called **semantic.py** and run all the code extracts above.
- Write a note about what you found interesting about the similarities
between cat, monkey and banana and think of an example of your own.
- Run the example file with the simpler language model `en_core_web_sm` and
write a note on what you notice is different from the model `en_core_web_md`.
### Compulsory Task 2
Let us build a system that will tell you what to watch next based on the word
vector similarity of the description of movies.
- Create a file called `watch_next.py`
- Read in the `movies.txt` file. Each separate line is a description of a different
movie.
- Your task is to create a function to return which movies a user would watch
next if they have watched Planet Hulk with the description “Will he save
their world or destroy it? When the Hulk becomes too dangerous for the
Earth, the Illuminati trick Hulk into a shuttle and launch him into space to a
planet where the Hulk can live in peace. Unfortunately, Hulk lands on the
planet Sakaar where he is sold into slavery and trained as a gladiator.”
- The function should take in the description as a parameter and return the
title of the most similar movie.

Note: Please make sure when running `watch_next.py`, that the `movies.txt` file is in the same folder.

## Requirements for the DS (Data Science) T22 Capstone Project

### Compulsory Task 3
- In a file called `nlp_1.pdf`, categorise which type of NLP application applies for each of the following use-cases:
(Use the categories we have discussed on this bootcamp so far)
  - A model that allocates which mail folder an email should be sent to (work, friends, promotions, important), like Gmail’s inbox tabs.
  - A model that helps decide what grade to award to an essay question. This can be used by a university professor who grades a lot of classes or essay competitions.
  - A model that provides assistive technology for doctors to provide their diagnosis. Remember, doctors ask questions, so the model will use the patients’ answers to provide probable diagnosis for the doctor to weigh and make decisions.


### Compulsory Task 4
- Read up on any innovative technology using NLP (by companies such as Google or IBM, for instance) and write a brief summary about the technology, what it achieves/does, and an overview of how it works (250 - 500 words).
To take an example, you may have noticed Gmail’s auto-response suggestions on your incoming emails. If I send an email to your Gmail address asking for an appointment, on opening the mail you would notice Gmail’s automatically suggested response options such as “Yes, that works for me” and “Sorry, I’m not available at that time.”
- Save your answer in a file called `nlp_2.pdf`.
