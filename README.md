# finalCapstone

Final Capstone Project from HyperionDev Bootcamp.
This project demonstrates an understanding of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and its applications.

## Requirements for the DS (Data Science) T22 Capstone Project

### Compulsory Task 1
- In a file called nlp_1.pdf, categorise which type of NLP application applies for each of the following use-cases:
(Use the categories we have discussed on this bootcamp so far)
  - A model that allocates which mail folder an email should be sent to (work, friends, promotions, important), like Gmail’s inbox tabs.
  - A model that helps decide what grade to award to an essay question. This can be used by a university professor who grades a lot of classes or essay competitions.
  - A model that provides assistive technology for doctors to provide their diagnosis. Remember, doctors ask questions, so the model will use the patients’ answers to provide probable diagnosis for the doctor to weigh and make decisions.


### Compulsory Task 2
- Read up on any innovative technology using NLP (by companies such as Google or IBM, for instance) and write a brief summary about the technology, what it achieves/does, and an overview of how it works (250 - 500 words).
To take an example, you may have noticed Gmail’s auto-response suggestions on your incoming emails. If I send an email to your Gmail address asking for an appointment, on opening the mail you would notice Gmail’s automatically suggested response options such as “Yes, that works for me” and “Sorry, I’m not available at that time.”
- Save your answer in a file called nlp_2.pdf.
